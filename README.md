# Portfolio Monorepo

This is a **monorepo** for my personal developer **portfolio**, structured to include both frontend and backend projects.

## Live Demo

Check out the live version: https://portfolio-one-sigma-71.vercel.app/

This is my personal portfolio site built with React and TypeScript. Right now, it showcases my information, but Iâ€™m planning to make it fully customizable, so anyone can clone it, update their details, and deploy for a professional portfolio in minutes.

Stay tuned for updates!
